Hey! Looking at your urgent tasks, here's what you should focus on today:

**Most urgent (OVERDUE):**
- Research meeting progress report - this was due today, so tackle this first if possible

**Due TODAY (5 papers to review):**
- Towards Conversational Diagnostic AI
- MEDDxAgent: A Unified Modular Agent Framework
- HealthBench: Evaluating Large Language Models
- Baichuan-M2: Scaling Medical Capability
- Doctor-R1: Mastering Clinical Inquiry

That's a lot! I'd suggest picking 2-3 of the most important papers to review thoroughly today, and pushing the others to tomorrow if needed. Want me to start a focus timer to help you power through some of these reviews?

I can see you've shared a beautiful forest image, but I need more information to help you track it properly. Are you looking to:

1. **Track a research paper** - If this is related to a paper about forests, ecology, or environmental science, I can help you record it with the full workflow
2. **Something else** - Please let me know what you'd like to track!

Could you give me the title or name of what you're trying to track? That'll help me get you set up right away.

   Introduction: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds immense promise, but also raises critical challenges, particularly regarding the interpretability and reliability of their reasoning processes. While models like DeepSeek R1-which incorporates explicit reasoning steps-show promise in enhancing performance and explainability, their alignment with domain-specific expert reasoning remains understudied.
