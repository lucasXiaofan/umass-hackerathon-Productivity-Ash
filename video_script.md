# Sage - 2 Minute Video Script

## OPENING (0:00-0:20) - THE PROBLEM

[Screen: Researcher drowning in open tabs, papers, scattered notes]

**Voiceover:**
"Okay, real talk. You're reading a paper, have a brilliant insight, and then... where do you write it down? Open Obsidian, create a new note, figure out the right folder, add tags...

By the time you've organized everything, you've forgotten half your thought. And then there's the other stuff - tracking deadlines, reviewing papers, not burning out. It's exhausting."

## SOLUTION INTRO (0:20-0:35) - THE HOOK

[Screen: Simple keyboard shortcut Cmd+Shift+E appearing]

**Voiceover:**
"So I built Sage. It's basically your research buddy who handles all the boring stuff.

Two keyboard shortcuts. That's it."

---

## SOLUTION - PART 1: INSTANT CAPTURE (0:35-1:00)

[Screen: Demo of Cmd+Shift+E capturing a quick note]

**Voiceover:**
"Cmd+Shift+E - got a thought? Type it, hit enter, done. Sage figures out if it's research or just personal notes, and puts it in the right Obsidian file for you.

[Screen: Demo of Cmd+Shift+4 screenshot + comment]

Cmd+Shift+4 - screenshot that important table or equation, add a quick comment. Sage extracts the text, formats it in markdown, saves the image. All your research notes, organized automatically in your vault."

---

## SOLUTION - PART 2: STANDARDIZED WORKFLOW (1:00-1:20)

[Screen: Shows paper tracking workflow]

**Voiceover:**
"But here's where it gets cool. Tell Sage to track a paper - it goes and finds the arXiv link, the GitHub repo if there is one, creates a clean markdown file in your vault, and sets a reminder to actually review it.

[Screen: Shows task management]

Your tasks? They're smart now. Homework that's past due gets archived automatically. Paper reviews get extended if you need more time. Weekly meetings? They repeat until the semester ends. No more manual updating."

---

## SOLUTION - PART 3: STAY FOCUSED (1:20-1:35)

[Screen: Shows timer shortcuts]

**Voiceover:**
"Need to lock in? Just type 'C' - boom, 40-minute focus timer. Type 'S' for a quick 25-minute Pomodoro.

It's all about making it stupid easy to stay productive without burning out."

---

## FUTURE VISION (1:35-1:55) - WHERE WE'RE GOING

[Screen: Futuristic visualization of agents collaborating]

**Voiceover:**
"This is just version one, though.

Imagine Sage helping you brainstorm experiments, managing your results across projects, even talking to other agents on your computer to code up your ideas while you focus on the science.

All the admin work? Gone. The note organization? Automatic. You just think and create."

---

## CLOSING (1:55-2:00) - THE PAYOFF

[Screen: Researcher confidently working, in flow state]

**Voiceover:**
"So you can spend your time on what actually matters - the innovation part.

Sage. Your research, but faster."
