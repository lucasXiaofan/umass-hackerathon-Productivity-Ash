However, they still suffer from factual inaccuracies and misalignment with user preferences in multi-turn interactions. We introduce an adaptive multi-agent response refinement framework that leverages a dynamic LLM orchestrator to engage specialized refinement agents. These agents iteratively refine initial responses generated by LLMs on the first always (prompted at all times) in a modular manner, focusing on three key aspects of conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we propose a gating mechanism that selectively incorporates agent feedback based on conversational context. Experiments on three dialogue datasets with three LLMs show our framework consistently improves response quality across all three aspects without introducing unintended changes to unrelated content. Our approach offers a flexible and modular solution for response refinement in conversational systems.\\n\\n## BibTeX\\n@misc{jeong2025adaptive,\\n  title={Adaptive Multi-Agent Response Refinement in Conversational Systems},\\n  author={Soyeong Jeong and Aparna Elangovan and Emine Yilmaz and Oleg Rokhlenko},\\n  year={2025},\\n  eprint={2511.08319},\\n  archivePrefix={arXiv},\\n  primaryClass={cs.CL},\\n  doi={10.48550/arXiv.2511.08319}\\n}\\n\\n## GitHub\\nNo GitHub repository found for this paper.\\nEOF\"}\n                                     tool_results: "

VibeThinker-1.5B | Hacker News\n   URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45910410\n   I gave it two tasks. &quot;Create a new and original story in 500 words&quot; and &quot;Write a Python console game&quot;. Both of those resulted in an endless loop with the model repeating itself \u00b7 I&#x27;m honest. Given that a 1B Granite nano model has only little problems (word count) with such tasks and given ...\n\n4. China Weibo Launches VibeThinker 1.5B: $7,800 AI Model Beats DeepSeek R1 in Math Reasoning - AI News Hub\n   URL: https://aiseotoolshub.com/news/weibo-vibethinker-ai-model-beats-deepseek-r1/\n   Visit the <strong>WeiboAI GitHub repository</strong> or find the model on Hugging Face and ModelScope platforms. The repository provides detailed setup instructions, including environment configuration and dependency installation.\n\n5. WeiboAI/VibeThinker-1.5B \u00b7 Hugging Face\n   URL: https://huggingface.co/WeiboAI/VibeThinker-1.5B\n   By systematically integrating these two phases, our approach establishes diversity as the central technical design principle, enabling VibeThinker-1.5B to achieve robust performance that surpasses conventional training paradigms. We recommend using this model for competitive-style math and coding problems. To facilitate quick verification by the community, we recommend the following parameter settings: temperature: 0.6 or 1.0, max token length: 40960, top_p: 0.95, top_k: -1. A more detailed evaluation scheme we have prepared can be found on GitHub."
