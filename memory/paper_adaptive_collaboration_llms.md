## Abstract
Foundation models have become invaluable in advancing the medical field. Despite their promise, the strategic deployment of LLMs for effective utility in complex medical tasks remains an open question. Our novel framework, Medical Decision-making Agents (MDAgents), aims to address this gap by automatically assigning the effective collaboration structure for LLMs. Assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the complexity of the medical task at hand, emulating real-world medical decision making processes. We evaluate our framework and baseline methods with state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of challenging medical benchmarks: PubMedQA, DDXPlus, PMC-VQA, Path-VQA, and MedVidQA, achieving the best performance out of 7 benchmarks that require an understanding of multi-modal medical reasoning. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive agent collaboration.
