## Abstract
Learning on the Job: An Experience-Driven Self-Evolving Agent for Long-Horizon Tasks proposes MUSE, a novel agent framework that introduces an experience‑driven, self‑evolving system centered around a hierarchical Memory Module. The paper defines three agents – Planning & Execution, Reflect, and a specialized Memory Module – which is split into Procedural, Strategic, and Tool Memory. This modular design aims to enable agents to accumulate knowledge, reflect on past actions, and improve performance over time.
