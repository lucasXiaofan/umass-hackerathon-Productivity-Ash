## Abstract
A-MEM proposes a novel agentic memory system that dynamically organizes memories for LLM agents. Inspired by the Zettelkasten method, the system generates structured notes for each new memory (including context, keywords, and tags) and analyses historical memories to form meaningful connections. This dynamic organization enables LLM agents to adapt to diverse tasks, improving context‑aware memory retrieval and overall performance compared to static memory baselines.
