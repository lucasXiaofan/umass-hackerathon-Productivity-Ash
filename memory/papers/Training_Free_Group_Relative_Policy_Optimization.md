**Abstract:**  
Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized real-world domains often degrades due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. This paper introduces Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), enhancing LLM agents without additional training via group relative policy optimization for better decision-making in domains.

**User Notes:**  
- Training-Free GRPO paper (correction: not RARE).  
- May use its method later for my agent's memory system.  
- Awaiting your review.
