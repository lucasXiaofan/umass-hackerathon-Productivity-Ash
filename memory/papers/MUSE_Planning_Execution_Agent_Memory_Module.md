## Paper Information
- **Title**: Learning on the Job: An Experience-Driven, Self-Evolving Agent for Long-Horizon Tasks
- **ArXiv ID**: 2510.08002
- **URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08002

## Key Concepts
MUSE introduces a novel agent framework with three main components:

1. **Planning & Execution Agent**: Breaks down long-horizon tasks into sub-tasks and executes them
2. **Reflect Agent**: Autonomously reflects on execution trajectories after each sub-task
3. **Memory Module** (Hierarchical):
   - **Procedural Memory**: Stores execution traces and raw trajectories
   - **Strategic Memory**: Converts raw trajectories into structured experience
   - **Tool Memory**: Stores and organizes tool usage patterns

## Key Features
- Experience-driven, self-evolving system
- Hierarchical memory organization for diverse levels of experience
- Continuous learning and self-evolution capability
- State-of-the-art performance on long-horizon productivity tasks
- Works with lightweight models

## Research Relevance
Directly related to LLM agent memory systems. Provides insights into multi-level memory architecture (procedural, strategic, tool-based) for autonomous agent learning and evolution. Relevant for understanding how agents can autonomously improve through experience reflection.
