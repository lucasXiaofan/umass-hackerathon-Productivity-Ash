# RARE: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language Models

## URL

## Abstract
This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are crucial.

## User Review (2025-11-13)
For my research, I am not going to use MCTS as it is too slow and medical reasoning is like open-ended question; MCTS is too rigid and doesn't yield good results.

## Status
Awaiting further review or updates.
