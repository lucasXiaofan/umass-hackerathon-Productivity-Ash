## Abstract
Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, we introduce PRIME (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that dynamically integrates System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of specialized agents for *planning*, *hypothesis generation*, *retrieval*, *information integration*, and *decision-making*. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy.
