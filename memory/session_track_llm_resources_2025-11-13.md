Context: Screenshot of VS Code workspace for project 'hackathon-umass'. User is running a streaming agent (streaming_agent.py) with screenshot capture support.
Observed items:
- Open files: src/streaming_agent.py, paper_adaptive_collaboration_llms.md (unsaved changes likely).
- Terminal shows agent greeting and asking: "would you like to start tracking academic resources for LLM agent development?"
- Commands visible: capture screenshot and analyze, send text to agent, quit.
- Recent screenshots (captured today): capture_20251113_073210.png, capture_20251113_073314.png, capture_20251113_073629.png, capture_20251113_073728.png, capture_20251113_073823.png, capture_20251113_074022.png, capture_20251113_074052.png, capture_20251113_074122.png, capture_20251113_074511.png, capture_20251113_074159.png.
Potential actions (based on prior user instruction to track academic resources for LLM agent development):
- Create a tracked entry for the open paper (paper_adaptive_collaboration_llms.md): search for the paper URL, save abstract, find GitHub if available, and attach screenshots.
- Leave session waiting for user's review before finalizing entries.
Suggested next step: Ask the user whether they want me to start tracking the open paper now (and whether to auto-search for URL/abstract/GitHub), or to do something else with the captured screenshots and agent session.
Status: Waiting for user's guidance.
